# Data Migration app

## Project description
This project was created in Java using JUnit, Log4J, JDBC and MySQL to read data from a .csv file, parse it, populate objects and add to a collection. The project is designed to demonstrate good programming practices in OOP, SOLID, design patterns, testing, logging, and efficient data handling.
The requirement was to use JUnit, JDBC and MySQL, it was challenging for me as I used them for the first time MySQL and JDBC, but I got a lot of knowledge and experience during this project.
